# Stirling.js

This is a super lightweight, vanilla JS library for creating interactive 2d content. I built this during a time when I needed to prototype a lot of different gameplay ideas quickly and get them in front of people for playtesting.

JS + Canvas is my go-to tool for such things, and after doing similar things a few times, I decided to create a really simple, but still decently fully-featured library to help myself and the other members of my team try new ideas quickly and easily.

This isn't meant to be a fully-featured engine (hence the name), but I've found it to be a useful tool nonetheless.
